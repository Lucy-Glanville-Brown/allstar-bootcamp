# Allstar Bootcamp
Portfolio Project 1 - Code Institute

This is a website for a Fitness Bootcamp in West Sussex. I am passionate about bootcamp style fitness having attended many sessions over the years and being impressed by what you can achieve when encouraged by others within a group.  I want the Allstar Fitness site to encourage users of the site to feel inspired to try a session and share the experience.
Information in the pages should portray the feeling of the team spirit and comradery within the group. There is a timetable of the days and times of the sessions, plus examples of the equipment and exercises that could be used.  There is also a contact page where the user can sign up and see a map of the location.  
The target audience would be people of all ages and abilities that are interested in group fitness in the local area.

## UX
### User Stories
As a user I would expect to see information about the bootcamp including times, place and contact information.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to include minimalist but useful information with eye catching images. This website is aimed to attract all demographics with an interest in attending a group based fitness bootcamp.

### Scope
For the users I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of what the bootcamp does on the homepage with the option to find out more by clicking on the links to the other pages.

### Structure
I wanted the homepage to be eye catching with a brief introduction to what the bootcamp is with the option to find out more by visiting the other pages. The navigation is clear to see and easy to use but I have also included links within the sections of each page.

### Skeleton
The wireframes were created using Balsamiq.

### Surface
#### Images
Each of the images used have similar colours and if there was more than one image on a page I tried to keep the colours the same. I wanted some of the images to show the team work and comradery between the participants.

#### Colours
The color chosen for the hero-text, timetable and sign-up form backgrounds was choosen using https://coolors.co/. I wanted a colour that would stand out but wouldn't look out of place against the hero image.

#### Typography
I decided to use “Josefin Sans” and “San-serif” for the main body text with “Raleway” and “Sans-Serif” for the headings. These were found by exploring Google Fonts.

## Technologies
