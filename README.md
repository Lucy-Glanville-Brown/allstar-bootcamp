# Allstar Bootcamp
Portfolio Project 1 - Code Institute

This is a website for a Fitness Bootcamp in West Sussex.

## UX
### User Stories
As a user I would expect to see information about the bootcamp including times, place and contact information.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to include minimalist but useful information with eye catching images. This website is aimed to attract all demographics with an interest in attending a group based fitness bootcamp.

### Scope
For the users I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of what the bootcamp does on the homepage with the option to find out more but click on the link to the other pages.

### Structure
I wanted the homepage to be eye catching with a brief introduction to what the bootcamp is with the option to find out more by visiting the other pages. The navigation is clear to see and easy to use but I have also included links within the sections of each page.

### Skeleton

### Surface
#### Images
Each of the images used have similar colours and if there was more than one image on a page I tried to keep the colours the same. I wanted some of the images to show the team work and camaraderie between the participants.

#### Colours
The color scheme was chosen to create ....

#### Typography
I decided to use “Josefin Sans” and “San-serif” for the main body text with “Raleway” and “Sans-Serif” for the headings. These were found by exploring Google Fonts.
